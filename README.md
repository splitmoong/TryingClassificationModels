Trying about different classification models with obesity dataset to assess their performance 

1. Decision Tree
   ->created a function that calculates entropy of the dataset

To Do

current
1. -> in dt, modify same function to give entropies and hence information gain of each feature.
future
2. Models -> SVM, KNN
